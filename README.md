# RFM9XLoRa-Net
A C# library for LoRa[@LoRaAlliance](https://lora-alliance.org/) connectivity for Semtech [@SX127X](https://www.semtech.com/products/wireless-rf/lora-transceivers/SX1276)/HopeRF [@RFMRFM9X](http://www.hoperf.com/rf_transceiver/lora/RFM95W.html) equipped shields on  Windows 10 IoT Core Raspbery PI devices.

My main use case for the Library is a telemetery field gateway uploading data from a number of remote devices.

The code has been tested with shields from [@Dragino ](http://www.dragino.com/products/lora/item/106-lora-gps-hat.html)

Most of my testing has been at 915MHz but I have some 433MHz devices on order.
